This is where I store my projects.

Projects:
1. YouTube downloader - using Python and Pytube, to download videos and get basic information about videos. However, if the video has an age restriction then I wouldn't be able to download it.
2. Boggle game - find words on the board using DFS. Implementing Depth First Search and backtracking that I learned in class to find all possible words in the board.
3. Python game - similar to Bomber, bomb it. It was my childhood game so I tried to recreate that using Pygame. It is a two-player game. You would have to destroy obstacles and then drop bombs to kill the player.
4.
